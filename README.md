# BL-compiler
In CSE 2231 (Software II), we created two classes (Statement and Program) that load BL source code
into abstract programs (Statement and Program) that later are converted into byte code and executed.

This project is an extension of this project that merges all of the code from those CSE 2231 projects 
into one functioning compiler.
